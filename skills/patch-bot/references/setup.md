# Setup routine

Run this once per target repo. Goal: leave the repo with a working Flow 2 (the fix
action) and a scheduled Flow 1 (the triage pass), and let the user verify quality
before anything goes fully autonomous.

## 0. Gather inputs (ask the user)

- **Target repo** — `owner/name` where fixes should be opened.
- **Sentry** — org slug, project slug, and an auth token with `event:read` +
  `project:read` (a Sentry *Internal Integration* token is ideal).
- **Anthropic key** — confirm `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exists as a repo secret (Flow 2 needs it).
- **Gate preference** — `label` (default, human presses go) or `auto` (full autonomous).

## 1. Scaffold Flow 2 (the fix action)

Copy `templates/claude.yml` → `<repo>/.github/workflows/claude.yml`. It triggers when an
issue is opened/labeled with `patch-bot:fix` or a comment mentions `@claude`, and runs
`anthropics/claude-code-action`. It needs the repo secret `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and the
default `GITHUB_TOKEN` (with `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write`).

## 2. Scaffold config

Copy `templates/patch-bot.config.json` → `<repo>/patch-bot.config.json`. Fill in with the
user. Do NOT put tokens here — only slugs and policy knobs.

## 3. Create labels

```
gh label create patch-bot      --color 5319e7 --description "Filed by patch-bot" --force
gh label create patch-bot:fix  --color d93f0b --description "Ask @claude to fix this"  --force
```

## 4. Register the schedule (the runtime)

Set up a Claude Code cloud agent / cron that invokes this skill in Run mode on an
interval (15 min is a sane default). Use the `/schedule` skill. The scheduled run needs
these secrets in its environment (NOT in the repo, NOT in config):

- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `GH_TOKEN` — a token that can open issues + apply labels on the target repo.

Remind the user: a cron run is headless — interactive OAuth/MCP logins won't be present,
so these must be real environment secrets.

## 5. First pass = dry run

Set `policy.gate` to `label` and tell the user to let one or two passes run so issues get
filed **without** auto-triggering fixes. They eyeball issue quality (is the fingerprint
right? is the stacktrace useful? is the repro instruction sound?). Only after they're
happy should they consider `auto`, and even then most teams keep `label` forever.

## 6. Summary

Print: what was scaffolded, where, the schedule cadence, the secrets still to set, and the
exact next action for the user (usually: "set the two secrets, then watch the first pass").
